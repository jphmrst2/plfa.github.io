## Recheck your configuration {#recheck}

 1. Make sure you have a local Agda config directory.

     - On *nix systems (linux and Mac), it is `~/.agda`.

     - On Windows, you should have the `AGDA_DIR` environment variable
       set to the path of some directory which does exist.

 2. Make sure there is a file `defaults` in the local Agda config
    directory, and that it contains the line:

        standard-library

 3. Make sure there is a file `libraries` in the local Agda config
    directory, and that it contains the line:

        /PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY/standard-library.agda-lib

    If you have installed the textbook sources as a standard library,
    then there should also be a line

        /PATH/TO/TEXTBOOK/plfa.agda-lib

 4. Make sure that

     - The directory `/PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY` from the previous
       step exists

     - The file `/PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY/standard-library.agda-lib`
       exists

     - That the latter file contains the lines

           name: standard-library
           include: src

     - That the following files (among many others in that directory)
       all exist:
    
           /PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY/src/Function.agda
           /PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY/src/Data/Nat.agda
           /PATH/TO/STANDARD/LIBRARY/src/Codata/Colist/Bisimilarity.agda

If any of these files are missing or are misaligned, then Agda will
either not be able to run, or will not be able to find standard
libraries.

## Google your error messages!

When you get an error message, feed it to Google.  You are not likely
to be the only person ever to have triggered this error!  Of course
you must be thoughtful about grabbing solutions from online â€” try to
understand whether the situation (as opposed to just the error) you
find is really the same as your situation, and make sure that they are
applicable to the same platform/version as you are running.

## Failures installing the Agda core system

### Stack fails to install the `zlib` (or other) library when installing Agda

Try installing the library from the normal installer for your system
(for example, `apt` on Debian or Ubuntu), before running `stack`.

### Stack reports that the file `user-manual.pdf` cannot be located

You do not need the Agda user manual to do the exercises in PLFA.
Remove the line containing `doc/user-manual.pdf` from the `Agda.cabal`
file in the `agda` directory which you cloned via Git.

### Stack reports an invalid byte sequence in a program called `happy.exe`

If you see an error message like this one

    happy.exe: src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar7.y: hGetContents: invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)

(possibly with a different file), then try setting the locale of your
machine to US English with the UTF-8 character set.  For example, on
Debian/Ubuntu linux, you would use

    apt-get install locales locales-all
    update-locale LANG=en_US.utf8
    LANG="en_US.utf8"

## Problems installing the standard libraries {#stdlib}

This section applies
 - **After** you have successfully installed Agda, and have
   compiled the `testdefs` example in the ["Installing the core Agda
   system" section][GettingStartedCore] without error.
 - **Before** you have compiled the `testnats` example in the
   ["Installing the Agda standard libraries" section][GettingStartedStdlib] without error.

### The `libraries` file contains the wrong directory {#wrong-libraries-dir}

If you are seeing output like this:

    Failed to find source of module Data.Nat in any of the following
    locations:
      /home/jm/Edu/421/agda/Data/Nat.agda
      /home/jm/Edu/421/agda/Data/Nat.lagda
      /home/jm/Lib/deb/agda-stdlib-mock/src/Data/Nat.agda
      /home/jm/Lib/deb/agda-stdlib-mock/src/Data/Nat.lagda
      [Possibly other files here]

Then you may have an incorrect directory in your `libraries` file, or
your Agda environment may be unable to find your `libraries` file.

#### incorrect directory in your `libraries` file

 1. If your `libraries` file contains the line

        /SOME/PATH/standard-library.agda-lib

    then the directory `/SOME/PATH` should look something like this:

        AllNonAsciiChars.hs    HACKING.md	     README.agda
        CHANGELOG/	       Header		     README.md
        CHANGELOG.md	       lib.cabal	     Setup.hs
        dist/		       LICENCE		     src/
        dist-newstyle/	       notes/		     standard-library.agda-lib
        GenerateEverything.hs  publish-listings.sh*  travis/
        GNUmakefile	       README/

    The directory `/SOME/PATH` should **not** contain a subdirectory
    `prim`, or a sibdirectory `Agda`, especially if is they are the
    only thing there!

 2. In Step 1 of [the "Installing the Agda standard libraries"
    section][GettingStartedStdlib], you ran these
    commands:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib.git
    cd agda-stdlib
    git checkout v1.1
    ```

    If you ran these commands from a directory `/WHERE/GIT/RAN`, then
    the contents of the `libraries` file should be
    `/WHERE/GIT/RAN/agda-stdlib/standard-library.agda-lib`.

    The contents of the `libraries` file should **not** be something
    within a `.stack` or similar generated directory.  It should be
    within the actual Git repository which you checked out.

#### Agda unable to find your `libraries` file

If Agda is not able to find the directory containing your `libraries`
and `defaults` files, then it will be unable to read them.

 - On a linux or Mac system, make sure that you have put those files
   in `~/.agda`.  (`~` abbreviates the home directory in *nix
   systems.)

 - If you are on a Windows system, or if you have verified the correct
   directory on a *nix system, then use the `AGDA_DIR` environment
   variable to name this directory.  Make sure that the environment
   variable is set before re-running Emacs or Agda.
